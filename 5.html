    The king felt insulted when the queen yawned during his poem recital. He believed she disrespected his poetry and stopped speaking to her. In truth, the queen was simply tired. This small misunderstanding hurt their relationship deeply until Tenali Rama wisely intervened and helped the king understand her innocence.

    Tenali Rama solved the problem with humour and wisdom. He acted out a farming scene, connecting yawning to daily life. The king understood his mistake and recognised that yawning isn’t offensive.
